//	You need to create an application that suggests to a user a famous song from their generation, 
//	based on when they were born. The users can either be {Boomers, GenX, Millenials, GenZ, GenA}.  You as
//	the programmer are actually a millenial, so you need to tell the user whether they are born before, 
	//after, or in the same time period as you.  

//	The famous songs for each generation are: 

//	Boomers - John Denver "Leaving On A Jet Plane"
//	GenX - Don McLean "American Pie"
	//Millenials - Rihanna "Umberella"
	//GenZ - Louis Theroux "Jiggle Jiggle"
//	GenA - Justin Bieber "Ghost"
